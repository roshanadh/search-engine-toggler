# Search Engine Toggler ![Search Engine Toggler Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roshanadh/search-engine-toggler/main/icons/icon16.png)
Google Chrome extension to auto toggle the search engine to be used when certain keywords are included in the requested URL.

## Why
When I have to use the DuckDuckGo search engine as my default, I miss searching for definitions in Google with `define` prefix.<br />
So, with this extension, whenever I use `define` prefix in any of my DuckDuckGo searches, it redirects to a Google search with the same query.

## Customize
Feel free to fork this project and introduce configurables within the extension to search for *any* keyphrase within a requested URL to trigger the redirect.
